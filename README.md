The data sets I have used has changed numerous times since I started working on this homemwork back in early May. Working with Teaching Assistant Mohamed Hamza, we set-up Python/Pandas code to combine numerous files from the last year. However, the resulting file was too large for Tableau Public to handle. Therefore, my Tutor Yuri Groza suggested I use Tableau Desktop. So I started down that path next, but ran into twoissues. One was that the Homework instructions say we 

# Rubric for Citi Bikes Analytics: 

## Discovered Phenomenon Visualizations. The submitted Tableau workbook includes all of the following:
✓ 11 total visualizations (I know we only needed to do 4-10, but one that I added at the last minute (called Count of Monthly Rides) wasn't very significant, but I thouht it would help show a trend...and I didn't want to throw away any of my prior work:) 
✓ A total of 2 dashboards (1 for each phenomenon)
✓ Data is cleaned (i.e. No outliers or bad data, Nulls removed)
✓ Visualizations can logically be used to discover the solved phenomenon (i.e. they are not just random visualizations) 	


## City Official Requested Maps. ADVANCED Visualization includes all of the following:
✓ Maped all bike stations
✓ Station markers indicate popularity by size of the filled in circle.
✓ Ability to change marker data based on month and year
✓ Sections are marked by zip code
✓ A write-up on the trends that were discovered while making the map


## Presentation. The Tableau story includes all of the following:
✓ Phenomenon visualizations
✓ Phenomenon dashboards
✓ One of the city official’s requested maps
✓ Arranged in a logical order (i.e. Visualizations for each phenomenon with each other, not all mixed up.)

I did the ADVANCED criteria to get the best greade possible, which includes for the ability to change marker data based on month and year. However, I also think it really helps tell the greater story. 
One of the trends that I observed by creating this was the popularity of the bike stations aoround Lower Mahattan area and the overall lack of usage of bike stations the further you get away form these key areas. While not every station falls into this cartegory, several of the key ones do. This analaysis is further supported/documented by the "Dashboard of Most/Least Popular Stations". Another interesting trend is the use of Jersey City bike stations. While they don't make the top 10, they definately have several stations that are more commonly used than others...just like in NY City. 


# Dashboard of Bike Usage Metrics
<img width="956" alt="Dashboard of Bike Usage Metrics_Updated" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96028923/171053713-985cb11e-3fbc-42ae-b780-33ec6f4b91e6.png">
There several phenomenons that can be seen by reviewing this Dashboard of Bike Usage Metrics. 
First, the two different Bike Usage (Start/End) by Hour of the Day charts 
This aligns with a very traditional beginning and end if a work shift in the USA every weekday (Monday through Friday). Another interesting phenomenon is the bike usage peaks between noon and 7pm on Saturday's and Sunday's. Again, it is very traditional that most workers do not go into an office on Saturday and Sunday in the USA. (see USA Breau of Labor and Statistics infor at https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/work.pdf and https://www.bls.gov/tus/charts/chart11.pdf).
Another phenomenon is the that the Annual Members took over 3.5M rides during this quarter and accounted for 36K hours, however their Average Duration was only about 10 minutes. At the same time, a casual user has the bike in use for almost 2 times that duration. That totally makes sense and many of their are out for a "Casual" ride...instead of husstling to/from work:)
